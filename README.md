WeightTracker is a fairly simple Rails-based application that allows users to track their weight in a single place.

* Built on Ruby 2.3.1, but has compatibility for Ruby 2.3.0. Rails 2.0.0 is not advisable.

* Requires jquery-rails, Postgres (my database of choice for Heroku deployment purposes), Bootstrap-sass, bcyrpt, attr_encrypted, and devise

* Built using Rails 5.0.0.1, but should have compatibility for Rails 5+.

* RBEnv is probably the easiest way to maintain Ruby/Rails environments on a machine.

* Running `rails test` is the preferred testing mechanism for now
